# Election-Results-Web-Scrape

This code will allow programmers to web scrape election data from Wikipedia and allow them to navigate HTML web pages with multiple tables.

With these results, programmers can create a [county-level](https://github.com/demography101/2020-Election-Results-by-Florida-County) map that displays the election results.
